# Karma

The concept of *karma* exists in many social networks but it is usually centralized: your karma is computed automatically based on certain factors.

Karma in **musocial** is very different. **musocial** counts the number of minutes you have listened to podcasts that support the [`podcast:value`](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md) tag. Once you have some listening history, you can choose to send a Lightning Network payment to support these podcasts. **musocial** will then keep track of the payments that you have sent.

The balance between what you have listened to and what you have paid can be viewed as your "karma", but this is not shared with anyone. It is **totally up to you** *if* and *how much* you want to donate to the podcast creators.
