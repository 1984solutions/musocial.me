## What is the story behind the logo?

The logo is a wordplay. Initially, when I decided to write my own RSS reader, I called it *ureader*, thinking about the *u* as a [*μ*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(letter)) that was wrongly written by a native English speaker. Later I replaced the *u* in the name with *mu*, but thinking about this *mu* not as as the greek letter, but as the Japanese [無](https://selftaughtjapanese.com/2019/01/15/mu-%E7%84%A1-the-japanese-word-that-means-nothing/). Later I found that the *usocial.me* domain was available and I thought this was way cooler than *musocial.me*, so I switched from *mu* back to *u* in the name while keeping the *mu* logo. Funny enough, this character is also read in Mandarin Chinese as *wu*, so it works.

Also, the logo looks to me a lot like a walled garden seen from outside. As people read more blogs and listen more to podcasts, they step out of the walled garden social networks.
