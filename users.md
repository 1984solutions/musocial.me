# musocial users

You can run musocial on your own machine or home server and totally forget about passwords and logging in, yet you can still use it in a multi-user setup if you wish!

By default, a user named `me` is created, without a password. If you keep this user passwordless it will be used to log in automatically, but you can always add a password to this user or create additional users.
