# Running

**usocial** is distributed as an app in the [Umbrel](http://getumbrel.com/) and [Citadel](https://github.com/runcitadel) app stores. This is the recommended way to run it.

If you want to run it outside these systems there are many ways to do it. See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ibz/usocial) for more details.
